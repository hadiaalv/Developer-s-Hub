üß† Machine Learning Project Suite

Welcome to this collection of practical Machine Learning projects built using Python. This repository demonstrates how ML can be applied to solve real-world problems in text classification and customer behavior analysis.



üìÇ Projects Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fake News Detection
Goal: Identify whether a news article is real or fake based on its content.

Highlights:
- Text preprocessing with TF-IDF
- Classification using Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest
- Optionally extended with LSTM for deeper learning
- Can be deployed as a web app for end users




2Ô∏è‚É£ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
Goal: Predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.

Highlights:
- IMDB review dataset (or similar)
- NLP pipeline using NLTK
- Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes classifiers




3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Goal: Segment customers into groups based on shopping behavior using unsupervised learning.

Highlights:
